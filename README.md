## ðŸš€ About me

Hello! Iâ€™m VinÃ­cius Martins!

I have solid experience in developing back-end and front-end applications with Java, JavaScript, and microservices architecture, as well as a strong background in building RESTful APIs and efficient integrations. I work with technologies such as Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, NestJS, Node.js, Spring Boot, Docker, and messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ), always applying best practices like SOLID principles and design patterns.

I also have experience with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), non-relational databases (MongoDB), and graph databases (Neo4j), as well as version control with Git, system modeling in UML, and leveraging AWS cloud services to build robust and scalable solutions.

I constantly strive for continuous improvement and delivering value through agile methodologies and modern development practices.
